As a student I have a Microsoft [Dreamspark](https://www.dreamspark.com/) membership, which has various benefits associated with it. One of these is the ability to develop a web app in a free copy of Visual Studio Community 2015, and publish it to Microsoft's [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) cloud service, all completely free.

I created a very basic website by following a tutorial on [MSDN](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_student_developer_blog/archive/2015/07/20/welcome-to-visual-studio-2015-with-azure.aspx). Over time I hope to get this website displaying data from my MySQL server.

The website I created is hosted on Azure at http://indoptim.azurewebsites.net. I would have liked to link a a subdomain of my indoptim.ie domain to this address using a CNAME record. I could not do this as Azure does not allow custom domains to be used when on a Free plan, and I can not afford to upgrade my Azure subscription.
